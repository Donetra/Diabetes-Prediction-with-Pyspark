# Diabetes-Prediction-with-Pyspark

Project Overview
This project involves building a logistic regression model to predict diabetes status based on patient data from the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. Utilizing PySpark MLlib, the project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning in medical data analysis, highlighting key predictive factors and providing insights into diabetes diagnosis.

Technologies Used
PySpark MLlib: Used for implementing the machine learning model, performing logistic regression to predict diabetes.
Google Colab: Provided an interactive environment to set up PySpark, execute data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation tasks.

Project Objectives
Predict diabetes status based on clinical data using logistic regression.
Explore and preprocess the dataset to improve model accuracy.
Apply PySpark MLlib to demonstrate scalable machine learning on large datasets.

Project Features
Data Setup: Configured PySpark environment on Google Colab to ensure all dependencies were installed and properly configured.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Preprocessed the dataset, including handling missing values and selecting relevant features to improve model training.
Feature Engineering and Correlation Analysis: Conducted correlation analysis to identify key features impacting diabetes, improving the accuracy and robustness of the model.
Model Training and Evaluation: Built a logistic regression model using PySpark MLlib, evaluated its performance using accuracy and other metrics, and applied the model to predict diabetes on a new set of unlabeled data.

Results
The logistic regression model achieved satisfactory accuracy in predicting the presence of diabetes.
The feature selection and correlation analysis helped in understanding the primary factors contributing to diabetes, enhancing model interpretability.
The application demonstrated the feasibility of using PySpark MLlib for handling large medical datasets.
